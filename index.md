## Meeting schedule

- January 27, 2021
- April 10, 2021
- June 22, 2021
- September 1, 2021
- November 16, 2021

## Maximum residue limits (MRLs) and trade

July 2020      Annual

- That we engage with governments and partners to create conditions that allow China to promulgate transparent, predictable, risk-based import tolerance regulations based on international standards and guidelines, recognizing that MRLs facilitate trade by verifying that pesticides have been applied according to registered label specifications and that they are not food safety standards.
- That we engage with governments and our partners to contain Europe's hazard-based approaches and defend risk-based decisions that allow farmers to continue to access modern tools and technologies that keep them competitive domestically and globally.
- That Canada’s current 0.1ppm import tolerance MRL default be retained.

Staff Directive, validated September 17, 2019   Annual

China Strategy

- If China's import tolerance policy towards Canada were to be predictable, this market would be a lower tier work priority.

European Union
- The current level of effort is appropriate with participation in the CLI MRL and Trade Task Force and the CLA Trade Team.

## National surface water monitoring for pesticides

November 2020     Quarterly

- That we are committed to the safeguarding of human health and the environment and proper stewardship of our products.  
- That the scope of a national surface water monitoring program be to:
  - Support stakeholder-led stewardship initiatives in preventing unacceptable levels of pesticides in surface water; and
  - Co-develop and consolidate national surface water monitoring studies to reliably collect robust, standardized data that can be used for trend analysis and to confidently refine post-market risk assessments.

## Ontario pesticide reform - urban

November 2020     Quarterly

- That the Government of Ontario lift the so-called "cosmetic" pesticide ban to instead return to a level playing field for Ontario homeowners and small business people.
- That the current “bylaw inoperative” clause (7.1(5) remain in effect (prohibits implementation of municipal bans). 
- That we do not support the creation of a new class of pesticides granting an application monopoly to licensed applicators to the detriment of homeowners.

## PCPA legislative review

November 2020     Quarterly

- That the PCPA remains fit for purpose and should not be opened for review.
- That existing irritants can be addressed without opening up the Act.

## PMRA re-evaluation process improvement

November 2020     Quarterly

The changes PMRA made to its re-evaluation process in 2016 have resulted in incomplete risk assessments and overly conservative decisions that unnecessarily restrict uses of high economic value.

While significant details on some of PMRA's 2020 program renewal proposals still need to be worked out, that the following new two-way dialogue opportunities to engage with stakeholders at key milestones in the re-evaluation process be implemented immediately:

1. Prior to initiation to identify areas of potential regulatory interest and data requirements;
2. After initiation during a deeper scoping and risk prioritization step; and
3. During the review at the draft risk assessment phase.

-	That the Government of Canada formally acknowledge the economic role PMRA plays in facilitating or inhibiting grower access to innovative technologies by including this in its mandate and by allocating the appropriate resources for this work.

Staff Directive validated November 19, 2019    Annual

-	The Committee directed staff to advocate for an economic/growth mandate for PMRA.

## Protected agriculture stewardship

_Growers need access to the full suite of registered minor uses of pesticides to remain competitive both domestically and internationally. To ensure this, potential pathways to the environment and the risks posed need to be proactively addressed in ways acceptable to PMRA. Protected agriculture systems consist of greenhouses, shade houses, nurseries and high tunnels._

January 2020     Annual

-	That a credible industry-led pesticide lifecycle stewardship approach be collaboratively constructed and implemented that includes adherence to national standards that are within industry control to support compliance with registered pesticide label directions and ensure the health and safety of people and the environment. 

Staff Directive updated March 10, 2020    Annual

-	Adherence to an industry-wide no-ship policy is how compliance would be ensured – all PCPA-registered products with label statements for greenhouse applications should be included.  A simple waiver form would allow facilities to access product for uses that are beyond the scope of Phase 1. 
-	While CLC is funding development of the program in collaboration with growers, audit and implementation costs should be paid directly by the audited facilities.

## CGC Market Acceptance Policy

_This industry-led policy strives to provide an appropriate balance between enabling the commercialization of innovative and new chemistry/crop use products, while assuring shippers and growers that Canadian exports are not exposed to unacceptable trade risks of shipments being rejected at port._

January 2020    Annual

-	That the policy is a work in progress in which CropLife Canada and its members are actively participating in with a view to continuous improvement. 

## CropLife Canada support of CAAR

Motion validated November 19, 2020

- Motion: That support for CAAR be left as a company-specific decision, that CropLife Canada representation on the CAAR Board is not merited at this time and that CropLife Canada instead support the CAAR Board when aligned with CropLife Canada priorities. 

## Certified Crop Science Consultant Program (CCSC)

March 2020     Annual

-	That the Certified Crop Science Consultant Program continues to provide value to members.

Staff Directive March 10, 2020    Annaul

-	As part of the next review cycle, invite CLC members to identify company representatives to review/recommend additional content for the CCSC program.
-	Amend the CLC Code of Conduct to ensure staff making agronomic recommendations have, at a minimum, either CCA and/or CCSC certification.
-	Review the program’s outreach activities to ensure member awareness.

## Defending modern pest control innovations

January 2020    Annual 

As seen with glyphosate in the United States and other jurisdictions, if left unchallenged, special interest group opinions may trump future risk-based regulatory decisions and could conceivably curtail any further public Government of Canada defense of the pesticide regulatory system and specific chemistries.

-	That CropLife Canada work to increase decision makers’ understanding and appreciation of the complexity of the systems used to produce the food we eat, its quality, affordability and other benefits including:
    - Plant science innovations are designed to optimize resource use for efficient food production;
    - Pesticides are designed to kill pests that threaten production; and
    - Both are carefully regulated to assure their safety to people, animals and the environment.
- That CropLife Canada continue to advocate the proven benefits of modern agriculture and that the potential risks are identified, thoroughly studied and proactively mitigated by Health Canada and the PMRA.  Benefits include:
  - An affordable, high-quality varied diet of fruit, vegetables and grain;
  - A smaller agricultural carbon foot print (less fossil fuel use, carbon sequestration); and
  - Restoration and preservation of wildlife habitat.
- That government decision makers acknowledge that the success of chemistry solutions is a prime target for funding by both genuinely curious researchers and those opposed to modern agriculture alike.
  - The more studies there are, the more outlier results there also are which can be selectively used to prove a point, whether positive or negative.
- That pest management plays a significant role in many aspects of the quality of life in Canada including:
  - Establishment and maintenance of lawns and gardens and public green spaces; and
  - Public health (control of mosquitos, cockroaches, bedbugs, lice, ticks, rodents and other disease vectors). 

## Drones: Canadian regulatory requirements
November 2020    Annual

- That drone technology presents an opportunity to advance our collective interests in precision agriculture, stewardship and the sustainability of our technologies. 

## Biopesticides and biostimulants

Staff Directive November 19, 2020    Annual

- Purposefully explore Canada’s biopesticide and bio-stimulant regulatory landscape including: striking a CSRC working group to identify and reach consensus on prioritization of current interests and recommendations on how best to advance them; staff participation in a small number of North American biologicals conferences; and liaise with FSAC and BPIA

## Fungicides: Pollinator health (see also Pollinators and neonics)

January 2020    Annual

-	That we work collaboratively with the beekeeping and agricultural communities to better understand the causes of poor colony health after pollination of blueberry crops.
-	That bee health is a complex issue impacted by a number of factors and the plant science industry is committed to doing its part to protect pollinators. 
-	That the plant science industry supports sound, science-based decision making around the use of pesticides as this relates to pollinator health.

## Manage Resistance Now

July 2020     Annual

- That resistance to plant science technologies is a serious issue for both the crop protection industry and the broader agricultural community and that CropLife Canada staff be committed to make resistance management a high priority in the organization.

## Neonicotinoids and agriculture

July 2020     Annual

-	That farmers use neonicotinoids because they are safe, environmentally friendly and provide targeted crop protection. 
  - Since only small quantities are needed to coat the seed, human and environmental exposures are reduced relative to other types of application technology. 
  - Using treated seeds can also reduce the need to spray insecticides multiple times to control insects.
-	That industry-led mitigation of identified environmental risks are recognized by the PRMA as effective. 
-	That the current duplicative provincial pesticide classification systems be replaced with ones that defer to the PMRA’s expertise and national safety mandate. 

## Plant Science Technologies: Helping Canada Grow

July 2020     Annual

- That plant science technologies are helping grow the economy, protect the environment and build stronger communities across Canada.
- That pesticides and plant biotechnology help save more than 35 million acres of natural land and protect Canada's biodiversity.
- $8.3 billion, or 71% of Canada's trade balance in crops, is directly attributable to innovations in crop protection products and plant biotechnology.
- Canadian families save an average of $4,400 a year on food costs thanks to efficient, high-yield farming practices.

## PMRA - cost recovery

Staff Directive validated March 10, 2020    Annual

That the following conditions need to be met before a conversation about cost re-recovery would be appropriate:
 - Data protection issues (PPIP) resolved to industry satisfaction;
 - Effective process improvements; and
 - PMRA being sufficiently resourced to assure the workload can be completed within a reasonable period of time.
  
 That conditions for cost-recovery to be considered include:
 - Clear data requirements;
 - Clear transparent processes; and
 - Strict adherence to time lines with meaningful recourse for missing them.



## Pollinators and neonicotinoids - Ontario and Quebec

March 2020     Annual

That:
  - The largest volume of neonic use is in Western Canada as seed treatments and bee keepers there are not concerned by neonic use - the number of bee colonies in Western Canada is about five times greater than in Quebec and Ontario combined. 
  - PMRA’s April 2019 final special review decisions on pollinators concluded that neonic seed treatments and use on greenhouse vegetables do not pose unacceptable risks to bees or other pollinators.
  - According to 2019 Statistics Canada data, the trend for the number of colonies nationally has been steadily increasing for many years, despite extensive use of neonic pesticides.
    - In Ontario there was a 10% decrease in the number of colonies with a corresponding decrease in honey production – there were 2504 commercial beekeepers.
    - In Quebec, the number of colonies and honey production remained the same as the previous year – there were 440 commercial beekeepers.


## Regulatory efficiency

January 2020     Annual

-	That regulatory reform is critical for agriculture to be a key player in the success of Canada’s economy as outlined in the Economic Strategy Table reports.  
-	That the promise to improve the sector’s regulatory environment is a welcome development for Canadian agri-food firms, however, the government needs to implement direct action to showcase our safe, high-quality agri-food products to the world.
-	That all departments, specifically Health Canada, PMRA and CFIA, must move forward with measures that, while ensuring health and safety, support industry and its ability to grow, innovate and produce food for domestic consumption and export. 
-	That we call for accountability, and action, to ensure the sector receives the support it needs to improve competitiveness.           

## Tank mix policy

November 2020     Quarterly

- That PMRA’s current policies allowing unlabelled tank mixes are safe and should remain in place to provide crop protection flexibility and application efficiencies.
- If legal clarification of what ‘following the label’ means is required, that this be addressed by amending the PCPA and not by needlessly creating market uncertainty and reducing grower competitiveness with their United States counterparts with no added benefit to the protection of human health and environment for Canadians.

## Urban pesticides

November 2020     Annual

-	That urban pesticides protect public and private green spaces from insects, weeds and diseases.
-	That homeowners benefit from the control a wide range of pests, including: cockroaches, ants, spiders, silverfish, flies, mosquitoes, fleas, ticks and bed bugs, rats and mice.
-	That pest control products are also used in plastics, paints, and caulking to prevent mold, and in toilet bowl cleaners and disinfectants to protect health.
